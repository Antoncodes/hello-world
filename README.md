# hello-world

Hey, it's Anton here. I love java, javascript and web-development!
I'm currently learning web-development @freecodecamp.org after which I'd also like to
learn server-side languages as well.

I'd definitely like to explore other programming languages as well.
I'm also open to learning new technologies and exploring the field of AI and machine learning.
